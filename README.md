## TI-84 Plus CE-T Python Edition

I have created this in Python, this means that you cannot use the standard TI-84 Plus CE-T for this. I might recreate it in C++ in the future to support the normal one too.

There aren't any colors because whenever I use color codes it makes it green and it doesn't use the hex value that I gave.

-   Open TI-Connect on your pc
-   Go to the second tab from the side-bar with the document icon
-   Connect your calculator with the Mini-USB cable to your pc
    -   Make sure your calculator is on
-   Select your calculator and drag the `ti2048.py` file in the list with all the other files and click send.
    -   Set the location to `RAM` (should be selected by default)

Now to run it

-   Press the `prgm` button
-   Select `Python App` and wait for a couple of seconds until it loads
-   Run the `TI2048` file and you're done
